[Half guard]({{page.wiki_link}}) is a common Jiu Jitsu position with a top combatant lying on top of the bottom combatant with one leg entangled. Half guard can be found when one combatant is attempting to escape a hold and recover guard. Half guard can also be found when transitioning from other guards. 

Depending on grips and body position half guard can favor either the top or bottom combatant. This leads to a wide range of passes, sweeps, and submissions that can be executed by either player. Due to the range of entries and advantages held by both combatants half guard is an important position to understand.

Below is a brief set of notes comipled from an excellent [half guard primer]({{page.yt_link}}) by John Danaher and Bernardo Faria. The notes follow a loose format and serve to:
