Something about how this is my obligatory linux command line reference. Work in a bash terminal in an almost daily basis. Here is a selection of the most common commands in my bash history. Due to there frequency I would consider them to be core and worth compiling here.

In no particular order here the core bash commands broken into categories.

## getting help

## directory navigation

## finding and searching

## interacting with files

## environment and arguements

## permissions and execution

## system and processes
