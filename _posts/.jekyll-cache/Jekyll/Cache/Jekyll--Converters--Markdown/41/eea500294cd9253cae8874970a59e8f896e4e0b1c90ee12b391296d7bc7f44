I"V<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38841408-5-rules-for-white-belts">5 Rules for White Belts</a> provides a useful conceptual framework for learning Jiu Jitsu.</p>

<p>Below are notes on the practice and philosophy of the system.</p>

<h2 id="rule-1-you-are-a-work-in-progress">Rule 1: You are a Work In Progress</h2>

<p>Be ok with getting crushed. Failure can be used.</p>

<p>Every session has a choice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Way of comfort</li>
  <li>Way of growth</li>
</ol>

<p>The choices exist in tension. Comfort provides success and feeds the ego. Growth risks failure but allows for new skills to develop.</p>

<p>Failure must be embraced and risks taken in order to advance. Seek out purposeful failure while training in order to grow.</p>

<h2 id="rule-2-narrow-the-immediate-focus">Rule 2: Narrow the immediate focus</h2>

<p>Focus on the four basic positions of Jiu Jitsu:</p>

<ol>
  <li>guard</li>
  <li>side control</li>
  <li>mount</li>
  <li>back</li>
</ol>

<p>These positions exist in a ladder of dominance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have partners back</li>
  <li>you are on top in mount</li>
  <li>you are on top in side control</li>
  <li>you are on top in guard</li>
  <li>you are on bottom in guard</li>
  <li>your partner has side control</li>
  <li>your partner has the mount</li>
  <li>your partner has your back</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to ascend and increase control over the other player. The upper half is offensive and the lower half is defensive.</p>

<p>Techniques are the tools used to ascend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reversals</li>
  <li>guard recoveries</li>
  <li>sweeps</li>
  <li>guard Passes</li>
</ul>

<p>The noviceâ€™s goal is to learn how to efficiently use tools to navigate the ladder.</p>

<h2 id="rule-3-learn-how-to-learn">Rule 3: Learn how to learn</h2>

<p>Mat time is finite. Time must be used efficiently to develop skill.</p>

<p>Questions must be asked in order to understand techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what is this?</li>
  <li>how is it done?</li>
  <li>why does it work?</li>
</ul>

<p>If what, how, and why can be articulated for a technique the principle is understood.</p>

<p>Keep a notebook and log training after each session. Review the notes between sessions.</p>

<p>Do not expect the instructor to provide all goals and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="rule-4-be-greatful-for-your-teammates">Rule 4: Be greatful for your teammates</h2>

<p>Jiu Jitsu cannot be practiced alone. The academy is a place for fellowship.</p>

<p>The Jiu Jitsu add:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Come work really hard at something incredibly difficult, where grown humans try to choke you. If like being sore, having injuries, and struggling come play Jiu Jitsu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Training partners are the obstacles used to develop skill. It is a reciprocral process and growth is not a competition.</p>

<h2 id="rule-5-jiu-jitsu-is-a-vehicle-for-something-more">Rule 5: Jiu Jitsu is a vehicle for something more</h2>

<p>Life is finite and Jiu Jitsu is not a sport to be won. It is a medium for personal development.</p>

<p>Use Jiu Jitsu as a support for the rest of life. Not as a distraction from reality.</p>
