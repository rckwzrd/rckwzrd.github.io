    <p>When I first installed Git I did not really know what it was for beyond interacting with Github. I learned the basics and got back to whatever project I was working on. Beyond cloning, committing, and pushing my Git skillset did not advance much over time. I got pretty far with fundamentals and simply keeping remotes clean.</p>

<p>Recenty I fell into a challening development situation that prompted me to learn more about Git and version control workflows. I read through the excellenat and free <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git Book</a>. This text covers the full spectrum of Git, from the basics of branching through Git’s internal state.</p>

<p>One of the most actionable learnings from this book is how to integrate Git with Bash to smooth out workflows and increase project awareness. Below are some notes on how to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>enable git command tab completion</li>
  <li>add git status info the the prompt</li>
  <li>set aliases to chain multiple commands</li>
</ol>
